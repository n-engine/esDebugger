This is the simplest I have created to show you how to use the esDebugger with a Dialog
based console reporting window.

window.cxx contain all the base to open a display for opengl es 2.0.
It contain also a simple dialog management for the calls history report.

test.cxx contain two simple example, breakOn(Error/Warning) and a loop to see the calls history.
